All disciplines use the phrase \u201cit is\u201d to describe and construct the concepts and objects within their domains. This project asks the question: what if we took all those descriptions, freed them from their original contexts, collected them in one database, and allowed people to reuse them for their own purposes? We believe that doing this will create new possibilities for what \u201cit\u201d could be, and will allow new realities to emerge. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWhat It Is\u201d proposes a new model for interacting with, and creating, knowledge, a model based on breaking down all texts into small, lightweight objects (i.e., statements) that can be explored and reused without the constraints of academic disciplines. This model aims to make knowledge more flexible, adaptive, recombinant, improvisatory, and collaborative. Accordingly, we leverage the open web technologies (HTML 5, Django) and practices that are essential to creating this transformation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe see \u201cWhat It Is\u201d as the first step towards a vast, open-source \u201cDatabase of Descriptions\u201d that breaks down ALL knowledge into small, discrete components for perpetual reuse. We invite the artistic, developer, and scientific communities to help us build this system and create applications that expand its capabilities. We invite you to help us discover what \u201cit\u201d is and, more importantly, to create what \u201cit\u201d could be.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Comments???</strong>", "enable_comments": false}}]
