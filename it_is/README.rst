    DRAFT

“What It Is” is a tool for collecting all statements, from all fields of knowledge, that describe what “it is,” and for remixing them into new knowledge. All disciplines use the phrase “it is” to describe and construct their respective realities, or domains of reality. “What It Is” asks the question: what if we took all of those descriptions, freed them from their original context, collected them in one database, and allowed people to take them and remix them for their own purposes? By doing so, we believe that new realties will emerge, new ideas of what “it” is, or could be, between and beyond all false distinctions of knowledge.

More importantly, “What It Is” is not a final product; rather, it is a proposition, a suggestion for a new model for interacting with, and creating, knowledge, a model premised on breaking down all sources of knowledge into forms conducive to large-scale collaboration and bottom-up creation of new knowledge (in this case, the form is the statement). It postulates new principles or criteria of knowledge: that it should be more lightweight, flexible, organic, recombinant, adaptive, improvisatory, and collaborative. Finally, it leverages open web technologies (HTML 5, Django), practices, and assumptions in order to bring these concepts to functional fruition, collaborative evolution and, hopefully, widespread adoption and adaptation.

We imagine “What It Is” as the first spoke in a vast “Database of Descriptions,” a massively collaboratively tool for breaking down all knowledge to the statement level. We imagine this database as serving as the foundation for the open-source, collaborative development of novel uses and applications of the core method and the collected materials. We envision the collaborative production of a vast and robust set of applications that utilize the database and expand its capabilities.  We anticipate tapping the developer community in similar ways to other great crowdsourced software projects such as Firefox and Linux.

Finally, we hope that “What It Is” will expose and explore the harm caused by fundamental barriers to such an open model of knowledge: namely, our extremist copyright laws, and the fact that most statements, most knowledge is still formatted in ways nonconducive to such a project.
